                                <p>Whilst seeking sanity after a bad hair year of
                                    relationship and business meltdowns, a mentally knackered, financially buggered, and a tad
                                    over stressed chap, Shane Wratt (aka Don
                                    Keebles), was enjoying many a whisky induced
                                    joke and yarn with some true blue mates
                                    during the whitebaiting season of 2008, at his
                                    mates pub on the West Coast near Karamea.
                                    One of which was Dave White who owned the
                                    pub. It was Dave and his partner Kirsty (aka.Kuze) who invited ‘Don’ over from Christchurch to stay, to take a breather from the
                                    city, and to forget the crap that was going
                                    down in Don’s wee world.</p>
                                <p>This area of the West Coast is an amazing part
                                    of our ‘god’s own’ as Don soon discovered. It is
                                    a place where wrist watches make good fishing
                                    sinkers, cell phones are useful as clay bird replacements, the ‘boardroom’ is on the beach
                                    with a bonfire and beers and a ‘conference call’
                                    means having a yarn over a pool table with
                                    more than two people. Embraced with scenery
                                    that is pretty much the way it was when Maui
                                    was learning to fish, it soon hits one as a mere
                                    mortal, that we humans can make life unnecessarily complicated, and we should be savoring
                                    the simple things in life.</p>    
                                <p>Family, friends, footy, fresh meat and fishing
                                    seem to be high on the list over here!</p>    
                                <p>It was when Dave, best mate of many, top
                                    bloke and owner of the pub, served up some of
                                    his fresh, deerly departed venison, wild pork,
                                    and his famous freshly filleted, battered and
                                    fried Rig, that it dawned on this sanity seeking
                                    fella that a sauce, to complement these famous
                                    meats with the West Coast Wild Food Attitude, was not to be seen at the bar leaner to go
                                    with their meat.</p>    
                                    <img src="assets/img/hero/hero.jpg" alt="">
                            </div>
                            <div class="right-content">
                                <img src="assets/img/hero/hero.jpg" alt="">
                                <p>What options were there to “tidy up the
                                    tucker” Don asked? And bugger me, there
                                    were bugger all! He contacted a mate of his
                                    who already made a range of sauces, but he was
                                    not interested in working together to develop
                                    such a sauce, which meant he had to give it a
                                    crack himself.</p>
                                <p>So, fueled with the West Coast atmosphere,
                                    the attitude of the people, the quality of the
                                    tucker and the heritage of our newly enlightened patron of the pub, Don set out to create
                                    a sauce that captured these elements, to be a
                                    best mate of meat and to complement the
                                    unique flavours that these premium meats
                                    oer! For the next 6 months, in his small kitchen at home, he produced over 40 dierent
                                    recipes and brews, supported with many a tasting session and a wee tipple with his mates, to
                                    eventually hone, refine and settle on the recipe
                                    that is now known as Glasseye Creek Wild
                                    Meat Sauce.</p>
                                <p>Our excited, no longer despondent sauce man
                                    Don Keebles now had a recipe that his mates
                                    on the West Coast approved of!</p>    
                                <p>It had a name, a label, a bottle and cork. He was
                                    brewing a few bottles here and there for mates
                                    who tried it and wanted more. Dave and Kuze’s
                                    pub then began serving it with most of their
                                    meals (not whitebait of course), and big Dave
                                    was using it in his marinades, roast meat gravies, casseroles, stews and pretty much everything he served from his legendary kitchen,
                                    which was the home of the famous ‘Fat Bastards Special’.</p>  
                                <p>But it was a passion only at this stage for Don,
                                    not a business.</p>

                                <p>It was when Dave White had his life tragically
                                    taken in July 09 when he was being a top bloke
                                    trying to help in a matter, that spurred our
                                    man into gear, upon realising how quickly life
                                    changes and the extent of change that results
                                    in losing someone close. Don wanted to give
                                    his sauce a nudge in the market place and to
                                    create something that would be a reminder for
                                    himself and many others of Dave, back when
                                    they were sipping Jamesons, savouring Dave’s
                                    generous and adventurous cooking, and sharing many a laugh and yarn. And all going to
                                    plan, Glasseye Creek could be a vehicle for
                                    some financial support for Dave and Kirsty’s
                                    daughter, Jessie May, to contribute towards
                                    education, plus assist in some way, to fill the
                                    huge void that Dave left in so many sectors
                                    that Dave was passionate about, such as the
                                    banning of the ‘lethal to our wildlife’ 1080
                                    drops around our beautiful forests.</p>
                                <p>After discussing the idea with a few mates to
                                    see how he could make it work with no money,
                                    of whom many said to Don “Good luck”, some
                                    suggested he gets a real job, and some said he
                                    was ‘dreamin’. But one said, ‘I’m with ya
                                    mate!!’ And that bloke, Yoda the Prawn Star,
                                    (as he is aectionately known on the Coast),
                                    who not only loved the new Glasseye Creek
                                    Sauce that Don had created, but shared the
                                    vision for the sauce, the yarn and the promise
                                    to Dave’s memory. </p>    
                                <p>The sauce, as is the story, is unique to our
                                    market, proudly developed to complement the
                                    wild foods of our amazing West Coast, and
                                    embrace a kiwi attitude that seems to be disappearing as our classic ‘older’ brands move
                                    oshore. Glasseye Creek Sauce has a very real
                                    story, connected to some very real mates, and
                                    from what people are saying, tastes pretty
                                    bloody good too!</p>

                                <p>So to all of our saucy mates, big thanks for enjoying our Glasseye Creek Wild Meat Sauce,
                                    and have a Jameson’s (ice only) in memory of
                                    our passed, but never forgotten, top mate
                                    Dave! The man that said to Shane (aka Don)
                                    “Get your arse out of that city, move on from
                                    from that shit that is buggering you right up,
                                    and see how we live over here! And who knows
                                    what may happen! Family and friends come
                                    first! And grab us a bottle of Jameson’s on the
                                    way…see you soon!”</p>
                                <p>Thanks Bud…the wisest words, always
                                    cherished, always reminding…..miss you mate!</p>
                                <p>Our excited, no longer despondent sauce man
                                    Don Keebles now had a recipe that his mates
                                    on the West Coast approved of!</p>
